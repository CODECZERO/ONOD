## Project Overview

**One Nation One Document (ONOD)** is a **secure, unified digital identity platform** designed to streamline citizen identity and document management.  
Built as a **prototype/MVP** for hackathons, ONOD demonstrates how **blockchain technology (Aptos)** can anchor proofs securely, while the user-friendly frontend allows citizens and organizations to interact with digital records easily.

**Key Goals:**
- Simplify citizen identity management in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³  
- Provide tamper-proof proof generation via SHA256 + blockchain anchoring  
- Allow verified organizations to add trusted updates  
- Enable easy verification, QR-based sharing, and export options

## Features

- âœ… **Citizen Registration:** Personal info, government IDs, education, employment, and health  
- âœ… **Secure Document Uploads:** Aadhaar, PAN, certificates, and other proofs  
- âœ… **Proof Hash Generation:** Deterministic SHA256 hash for each submission  
- âœ… **QR Code Generation:** Quick proof sharing and verification  
- âœ… **Organization Portal:** Verified updates from hospitals, schools, banks, etc.  
- âœ… **Admin Dashboard:** Inspect, export, and manage submissions  
- âœ… **Blockchain Prototype:** Proof hashes can be anchored on Aptos for immutability
